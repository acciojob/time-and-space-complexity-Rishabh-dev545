    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. An efficient algorithm is one that performs its task in the least possible time, ensuring optimal performance as input size grows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. It is commonly expressed as O(n), where n is the input size, indicating that the memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the input data.
